‚¶ø `Motivation`: Due to all kinds of reasons like failure of collection sensors, communication error,
and unexpected malfunction, missing values are common to see in time series from the real-world environment.
This makes partially-observed time series (POTS) a pervasive problem in open-world modeling and prevents advanced
data analysis. Although this problem is important, the area of machine learning on POTS still lacks a dedicated toolkit.
PyPOTS is created to fill in this blank.

‚¶ø `Mission`: PyPOTS (pronounced "Pie Pots") is born to become a handy toolbox that is going to make machine learning on POTS easy rather than
tedious, to help engineers and researchers focus more on the core problems in their hands rather than on how to deal
with the missing parts in their data. PyPOTS will keep integrating classical and the latest state-of-the-art machine learning
algorithms for partially-observed multivariate time series. For sure, besides various algorithms, PyPOTS is going to
have unified APIs together with detailed documentation and interactive examples across algorithms as tutorials.

ü§ó **Please** star this repo to help others notice PyPOTS if you think it is a useful toolkit.
**Please** properly [cite PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS#-citing-pypots) in your publications
if it helps with your research. This really means a lot to our open-source research. Thank you!

## ‚ùñ PyPOTS Ecosystem
At PyPOTS, things are related to coffee, which we're familiar with. Yes, this is a coffee universe!
As you can see, there is a coffee pot in the PyPOTS logo.
And what else? Please read on ;-)

<a href="https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB">
    <img src="https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/TSDB_logo_FFBG.svg" align="left" width="140" alt="TSDB logo"/>
</a>

üëà Time series datasets are taken as coffee beans at PyPOTS, and POTS datasets are incomplete coffee beans with missing parts that have their own meanings.
To make various public time-series datasets readily available to users,
<i>Time Series Data Beans (TSDB)</i> is created to make loading time-series datasets super easy!
Visit [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB) right now to know more about this handy tool üõ†, and it now supports a total of 168 open-source datasets!

<a href="https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyGrinder">
    <img src="https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/PyGrinder_logo_FFBG.svg" align="right" width="140" alt="PyGrinder logo"/>
</a>

üëâ To simulate the real-world data beans with missingness, the ecosystem library [PyGrinder](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyGrinder),
a toolkit helping grind your coffee beans into incomplete ones, is created. Missing patterns fall into three categories according to Robin's theory[^13]:
MCAR (missing completely at random), MAR (missing at random), and MNAR (missing not at random).
PyGrinder supports all of them and additional functionalities related to missingness.
With PyGrinder, you can introduce synthetic missing values into your datasets with a single line of code.

<a href="https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS">
    <img src="https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/BrewPOTS_logo_FFBG.svg" align="left" width="140" alt="BrewPOTS logo"/>
</a>

üëà Now we have the beans, the grinder, and the pot, how to brew us a cup of coffee? Tutorials are necessary!
Considering the future workload, PyPOTS tutorials are released in a single repo,
and you can find them in [BrewPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS).
Take a look at it now, and learn how to brew your POTS datasets!

‚òïÔ∏è Welcome to the universe of PyPOTS. Enjoy it and have fun!

We present you a usage example of imputing missing values in time series with PyPOTS below, you can click it to view.

<details open>
<summary><b>Click here to see an example applying SAITS on PhysioNet2012 for imputation:</b></summary>

``` python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from pygrinder import mcar
from pypots.data import load_specific_dataset
from pypots.imputation import SAITS
from pypots.utils.metrics import calc_mae

# Data preprocessing. Tedious, but PyPOTS can help.
data = load_specific_dataset('physionet_2012')  # PyPOTS will automatically download and extract it.
X = data['X']
num_samples = len(X['RecordID'].unique())
X = X.drop(['RecordID', 'Time'], axis = 1)
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X.to_numpy())
X = X.reshape(num_samples, 48, -1)
X_ori = X  # keep X_ori for validation
X = mcar(X, 0.1)  # randomly hold out 10% observed values as ground truth
dataset = {"X": X}  # X for model input
print(X.shape)  # (11988, 48, 37), 11988 samples, 48 time steps, 37 features

# Model training. This is PyPOTS showtime.
saits = SAITS(n_steps=48, n_features=37, n_layers=2, d_model=256, d_inner=128, n_heads=4, d_k=64, d_v=64, dropout=0.1, epochs=10)
# Here I use the whole dataset as the training set because ground truth is not visible to the model, you can also split it into train/val/test sets
saits.fit(dataset)
imputation = saits.impute(dataset)  # impute the originally-missing values and artificially-missing values
indicating_mask = np.isnan(X) ^ np.isnan(X_ori)  # indicating mask for imputation error calculation
mae = calc_mae(imputation, np.nan_to_num(X_ori), indicating_mask)  # calculate mean absolute error on the ground truth (artificially-missing values)
```

## ‚ùñ Available Algorithms
PyPOTS supports imputation, classification, clustering, and forecasting tasks on multivariate time series with missing values.
The currently available algorithms of four tasks are cataloged in the following table with four partitions.
The paper references are all listed at the bottom of this readme file. Please refer to them if you want more details.

üåü Since **v0.2**, all neural-network models in PyPOTS has got hyperparameter-optimization support.
This functionality is implemented with the [Microsoft NNI](https://github.com/microsoft/nni) framework.

## ‚ùñ Citing PyPOTS
**[Updates in Jun 2023]** üéâA short version of the PyPOTS paper is accepted by the 9th SIGKDD international workshop on
Mining and Learning from Time Series ([MiLeTS'23](https://kdd-milets.github.io/milets2023/))).
Besides, PyPOTS has been included as a [PyTorch Ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) project.

The paper introducing PyPOTS is available on arXiv at [this URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18811),
and we are pursuing to publish it in prestigious academic venues, e.g. JMLR (track for
[Machine Learning Open Source Software](https://www.jmlr.org/mloss/)). If you use PyPOTS in your work,
please cite it as below and üåüstar this repository to make others notice this library. ü§ó

There are scientific research projects using PyPOTS and referencing in their papers.
Here is [an incomplete list of them](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2022&q=%E2%80%9CPyPOTS%E2%80%9D&hl=en>).

## ‚ùñ Contribution
You're very welcome to contribute to this exciting project!

By committing your code, you'll

1. make your well-established model out-of-the-box for PyPOTS users to run,
   and help your work obtain more exposure and impact.
   Take a look at our [inclusion criteria](https://docs.pypots.com/en/latest/faq.html#inclusion-criteria).
   You can utilize the `template` folder in each task package (e.g.
   [pypots/imputation/template](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/tree/main/pypots/imputation/template)) to quickly start;
2. be listed as one of [PyPOTS contributors](https://pypots.com/about/#all-contributors);
3. get mentioned in our [release notes](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/releases);

You can also contribute to PyPOTS by simply staringüåü this repo to help more people notice it.
Your star is your recognition to PyPOTS, and it matters!

## ‚ùñ Community
We care about the feedback from our users, so we're building PyPOTS community on

- [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/pypots-org/shared_invite/zt-1gq6ufwsi-p0OZdW~e9UW_IA4_f1OfxA). General discussion, Q&A, and our development team are here;
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pypots). Official announcements and news are here;
- [WeChat (ÂæÆ‰ø°ÂÖ¨‰ºóÂè∑)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/sNgZmgAyxDn2sZxXoWJYMA). We also run a group chat on WeChat,
  and you can get the QR code from the official account after following it;

If you have any suggestions or want to contribute ideas or share time-series related papers, join us and tell.
PyPOTS community is open, transparent, and surely friendly. Let's work together to build and improve PyPOTS!
